# Yesdude Rotate
---
This is a simple Windows tray application for rotating screens when you have multiple monitors.
---
### Known issues.

When the tray icons are loaded and there is a hardware change (I.E. Docked or Undocked) the enumeration of the screens may not reset properly. Restarting Windows fixes this issue.
